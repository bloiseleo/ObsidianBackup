The Java Programming Language was born aiming to write once and run everywhere. The main goal is to write an application and have it working on whatever device your friends have.
## How it Works
### Source Code
At first, you'll need to write your code. It'll be most of the times in Java, but you can write Scala, Kotlin and any other language supported by the Java Virtual Machine.
### Bytecode
When your code goes through the compiler, it will checks for errors and won't let you compile the code until you fix it. When it compiles, it'll create a document called `bytecode`, which contains your code ready to be executed. This code is platform independent, so, any place that is able to run java, it'll be able to run the program.
### Java Virtual Machine
The Java Virtual Machine is a software that is capable to run java software.
