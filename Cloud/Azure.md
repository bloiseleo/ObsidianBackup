## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the provisioning of computing resources, like CPU power, storage, network, servers, databases and so on. These services can be used and configured through the internet using the terminal or a Web View.
#### Advantages
- Keeping a whole datacenter can be very expensive. Then, using the datacenter of another company, you can delegate all the burden of taking care of the hardware to this other company. 
- Pay-as-you-go is a pricing model where you pay for the time of usage for that resource and nothing more.
- You can have the same service and server in a group of regions and take advantage of geographic location.
